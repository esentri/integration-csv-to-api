# integration-csv-to-api Project

A small example that shows how to consume a CSV file and invoke an API with data from the CSV file. 
It uses Quarkus and Apache Camel. 

Put a CSV file into folder /test/resources to activate the integration. Some test files can be found in /test/resources/test-files
The API called by the integration is also available within this project.


You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.


The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.
